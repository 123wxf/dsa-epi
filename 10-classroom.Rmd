We use [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) to host the
repos of all homework submissions. The 

## Jump start with Git and GitHub
Work on the exercises of the first two sections of the free online Git
tutorial at [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/git).

## Get familiar with building from source

Use Git to clone the source of Hadley Wickham's
**Advanced R Programming**
from his GitHub repository to a local space on your own
computer. Build the book using RStudio. During the building process,
you may see error messages due to missing tools on your computer. Read
the error messages carefully and fix them. Keep trying until you build
the book. You may need to install some R packages, some fonts, some \LaTeX\
packages, and some building tools for R packages. On Windows, some
codes for parallel computing may not work and need to be swapped
out. Document the problems you encountered and how you solved them in
an R Markdown file named `README.Rmd`. Push it to your homework GitHub
repository so that it can help other students to build the book.

## Using RMarkdown
Use **bookdown** or **rmarkdown** to produce a report for the
following task. Consider approximation of the distribution function of
$N(0, 1)$,
\begin{equation}
\Phi(t) = \int_{-\infty}^t \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-y^2 / 2} \dd y,
(\#eq:cdf)
\end{equation}
by the Monte Carlo methods:
\begin{equation}
\hat\Phi(t) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n I(X_i \le t),
\end{equation}
where $X_i$'s are a random sample from $N(0, 1)$, and $I(\cdot)$ is
the indicator function. Experiment with the approximation at
$n \in \{10^2, 10^3, 10^4\}$ at
$t \in \{0.0, 0.67, 0.84, 1.28, 1.65, 2.32, 2.58, 3.09, 3.72\}$ to
form a table.


The table should include the true value for comparison.
Further, repeat the experiment 100 times. Draw box plots of the 100
approximation errors at each $t$ using **ggplot2** [@R-ggplot2] for
each $n$. The report should look like a manuscript, with a title, an
abstract, and multiple sections. It should contain at least one math
equation, one table, one figure, and one chunk of R code. The template
of our Data Science Lab can be helpful:
<https://statds.org/template/>, the source of which is at
<https://github.com/statds/dslab-templates>.

<!-- You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods). -->

<!-- Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively. -->

<!-- ```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) -->
<!-- plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab). -->

<!-- ```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::kable( -->
<!--   head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!', -->
<!--   booktabs = TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015]. -->
